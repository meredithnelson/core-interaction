      Throughout the years, the national football league (NFL)
      has gone from hand made designs to creating a brand for modernistic
      corporations. American football is one of the best examples for how
      design has transformed from a generic passing time to one of the most
      popular forms of entertainment, whether you a player or a fan.

      Identity systems have been created within sports teams such as the
      Cleveland Rams. A team that has called numerous cities their home.
      Starting off with a vintage and simplistic logo, an
      “art-graduate-turned-professional-football-player”,
      Fred Gehrke began with creating the infamous Ram helmets.
      He was bored with the unfamiliar helmet that didn’t bring
      any source of excitement to the team. He designed a brilliant
       design on the helmet; the Rams horn. By putting this one element
        on the players helmets, he created a helmet their brand identity entirely.

        A quote that stood out to me in this
        article spoke about the charm old designs had on sports teams back then.

        <div id="pullquote">
          <p>The timelessness, honesty and soul the sport had back then is mostly
          due to the fact the entire industry was produced by hand.</p>
        </div>

      Post-war came around and the production of uniforms and
    helmets went from wood to plastic. It was shortly after
    that most teams brand identity became more prominent due
    to the easy access of production. At this time, you saw an
    increase in clear, bold designs because it felt new and
    more connected to society. It was not so separated from
    other forms of entertainment.

    When you look at teams logos today, you notice a sense
    of old school design.

      The Golden Era of Graphic design included some of these
      classic logos, including the Steelers, Chicago Cubs, and
      Chicago Bulls. In today’s sports branding, we see a step
      back from modernist approaches and back to the old school ways of design.
