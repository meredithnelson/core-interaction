        <P>One sixty over ninety is a branding agency mainly focused on
    sports (whether it is professional, college or events). Based out
    of Philadelphia but also have offices in Columbus, Newport Beach,
    and Gainesville, they are focused on changing a company’s style and making it
    powerful, impactful and successful. Many of their clients are universities
    that want a change in their following. Maybe it’s the design of their brand
    or the social impact they need help with, one sixty over ninety is there to
    help make that possible.</P>

  <P>A recent client that worked with the agency was the University of Florida.
    Changing both their academia branding as well as their sports, the Florida
    gators wanted a new approach. A united community, rich with history and honor;
    one sixty over ninety had a big job on their hands. What it means to be a “gator”
    was a question filled with many answers.</P>

<P>As a result to their deep research and non-stop work, one sixty over ninety’s end result was one to admire. Their understanding and respect of the school made the brand so powerful. Without knowing your client, you are unaware of the powerful end result. It is a clear indication that not only do you have to know the client you’re working with but you have to dig deep and really put yourself in the shoes of the students, the players, the teachers; everyone. Without doing that you are not understanding who they really are and what the university stands for.<P>


<P>Playing in the fiercely competitive SEC as well as battling in-state rivals for the nation’s top recruits had helped the Gators rack up 33 national championships, over 260 individual national champions and 100 Olympic medals. Yet, UF was still primarily known for its gridiron accomplishments. We leveraged that strength and, through an investigation process that included interviews with over 300 people across the athletics department, developed a brand that changed the perception from football school to a destination for winning athletes.</P>
