        <p>For Brandiose, business is booming.</p>

  <p>Working with more than 50 teams, including the Akron RubberDucks, the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, and the Biloxi Shuckers. The company was founded as Plan B Branding in 2000, but Klein and White have known each other since kindergarten.
    When in college, Jason Klein and Casey White sent over 150 letters to minor league teams asking for work. Out of all the letters they sent, the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx’s responded. They took over their design and created a genius logo. Making a character out of minor and his baseball bat into an ax. People loved this playful take.</p>

  <p>Over the next few years, Brandiose was booming. They worked with the Rockies’ rookie club in Wyoming in their new name change to, the Casper Ghosts. The following season, the players wore baseball’s first on-field glow in the dark hats. The same Spring, the former Ottawa Lynx, played their first game as the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. The team was named for pig iron, Eastern Pennsylvania’s famous product. The award winning logo was a pig’s head with rivets. Their branding ideas lead the minor league sales that year in 2008.</p>

  <p>Most of what Brandiose work is, is rebranding and recreating teams that need a boost. Their mission is to make teams more recognizable. Changing their look into something that fans can follow, wear and support. I think this such a great example of a success story. They work everyday to try and make minor league teams successful, which is often an overlooked side of sports.</p>

        <div id="pullquotePost">
          </p>The two of us grew up in San Diego, and have been best friends since kindergarten. As kids, we loved telling stories and bringing creative ideas to life.  Once in college, we started designing high school logos out of our dorm rooms. We then sent letters to 150 Minor League Baseball teams, and only one got back to us: the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx. They told us, “If we like it, we’ll buy it.”  That summer we set out with the same goal we have today:  Doing whatever it takes to make teams famous.</p>
