        <p>April 28, 2018 marked the 2018 NFL Draft. The NFL Draft is a yearly meeting of national football leagues who choose new players for their upcoming season. The meeting was held in Arlington, Texas at the AT&T Stadium where thousands of people come to watch and root for their favorite teams and players.</p>

        <p>It was broadcasted on television where another set of people watched. Since this is such a highly anticipated event, a brand must be made. A logo was created in honor of this event, as well as advertisements on subways, streets, and television commercials. What draws viewers into this is the immense amount of suspense they get from their favorite players on a college team becoming drafted. Will Baker Mayfield get first pick? (Spoiler Alert: He did, to the Cleveland Browns.)</p>

        <p>Baker Mayfield, the number one overall draft pick from the University of Oklahoma, was the first pick, not to many viewers surprise. Once he was picked he stepped out with a Browns hat on. This is a symbolic and iconic act each draft pick does once they have been chosen to a team. They wear the logo of their new team indicating they now represent them.</p>

        <p>Logos play a huge part in this meeting, simply because each player is wearing their new teams logo by the end of the night. They also take a picture with their new jersey and the teams coach and that is the start of their journey.</p>
