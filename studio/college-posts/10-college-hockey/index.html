        <p>College hockey’s recruitment process is often one of confusion and early commitments.</p>

        <p>There are many rules and regulations that players have to follow as well NCAA recruiters. High school students may not be officially recruited by college coaches before January 1st of their sophomore year in high school. The recruiting process is similar to college football recruitment, certain schools are more desirable than others due to the reputation that follows them.</p>

        <p>Schools like University of Michigan, Northeastern University, Boston University and University of Vermont are all schools that get the best high school players. The recruiting system is very organized and well thought out. High school players commit early because they are scouted for so long. Players have a unique part in this because they have the choice of schools at such a young age.</p>

        <p>What draws players to certain schools? The power and following behind the team. Some schools have huge hockey followings, usually in the North East, hockey is a big part of people’s lives. Hockey is the “football” in some New England towns. Just like football, it is important for an elite player to go to a reputable team because they want to be reputable themselves. While hockey isn’t as branded and noticeable consist of who the players are and how well they play. That is what causes crowds to come watch.</p>
