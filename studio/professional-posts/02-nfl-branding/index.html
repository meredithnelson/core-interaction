        NFL

      <div id="body">
      Throughout the years, the national football league (NFL)
      has gone from hand made designs to creating a brand for modernistic
      corporations. American football is one of the best examples for how
      design has transformed from a generic passing time to one of the most
      popular forms of entertainment, whether you a player or a fan.

      Identity systems have been created within sports teams such as the
      Cleveland Rams. A team that has called numerous cities their home.
      Starting off with a vintage and simplistic logo, an
      “art-graduate-turned-professional-football-player”,
      Fred Gehrke began with creating the infamous Ram helmets.
      He was bored with the unfamiliar helmet that didn’t bring
      any source of excitement to the team. He designed a brilliant
       design on the helmet; the Rams horn. By putting this one element
        on the players helmets, he created a helmet their brand identity entirely.

        A quote that stood out to me in this
        article spoke about the charm old designs had on sports teams back then.

        <div id="pullquote">
          <p>The timelessness, honesty and soul the sport had back then is mostly
          due to the fact the entire industry was produced by hand.</p>
        </div>

          <img width="250" height="250" src="media/img/ramshelmet.png">

      </div>
      </figure>
      Post-war came around and the production of uniforms and
    helmets went from wood to plastic. It was shortly after
    that most teams brand identity became more prominent due
    to the easy access of production. At this time, you saw an
    increase in clear, bold designs because it felt new and
    more connected to society. It was not so separated from
    other forms of entertainment.

    When you look at teams logos today, you notice a sense
    of old school design.

      The Golden Era of Graphic design included some of these
      classic logos, including the Steelers, Chicago Cubs, and
      Chicago Bulls. In today’s sports branding, we see a step
      back from modernist approaches and back to the old school ways of design.

      Self promoting is not commonly known in the world of hockey.
      A sport that is known to be more quiet and out of the spotlight, the players
      have mostly done the same. Recently however, players have
      been more intune with self-promoting.

      Last year Sidney Crosby (Pittsburgh Penguins) earned $4.5 million in endorsement dollars.
      This is no comparison to the likes of Lebron James or Peyton Manning,
      who each earned $44 million and $12 million last year,
      or the Houston Rockets’ James Harden, who just signed an endorsement
      deal with Adidas that will pay him over $15 million per season. It is interesting
      that hockey players aren't usually as involved with brands or endorsed by certain
      companies wanting them to be the face of their brand. This is a strong statement
      to understand that some of us don't know the names of famous hockey players (other than
      the household names like Wayne Gretzky). But we know the names of famous football players
      simply because we see them on ads. This is a powerful statement when it comes to branding yourself.

      PK Subban (Nashville Predators) has become apart of this branding spotlight this year. Known for his
      budding personality and tailored suits, Subban has gained attention. But not just attention, respect.


        <div id="pullquote">
          <p>Subban has signed sponsorship deals with Samsung, Gatorade, RBC, Degree,
            Boston Pizza, Hyundia, and Nike</p>
        </div>

      The NHL has progressively evolved to embracing Subban’s
      personality. When Subban was featured in a backstage video
      series in 2014, the NHL media gained popularity which also
      means they gained followers. They changed their approach to
      marketing which helped them gain more of a following. Another
      popular example would move towards social media. When the LA Kings
      tweeted their victory over the Vancouver Canucks (2012), fans liked
      that. Fans retweeted causing news to flow through many different mediums.

      All of this is a great example of how important a player can be for a team.
      Whether it is for the NHL or any team, a player can cause fandom, which markets
      not just them personally, but the team.
