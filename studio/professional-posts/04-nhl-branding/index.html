      <p>Self promoting is not commonly known in the world of hockey.
        A sport that is known to be more quiet and out of the spotlight, the players
        have mostly done the same. Recently however, players have
        been more intune with self-promoting.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Last year Sidney Crosby from the <span id="penguins-button">Pittsburgh Penguins</span>
            earned $4.5 million in endorsement dollars.
            This is no comparison to the likes of Lebron James or Peyton Manning,
            who each earned $44 million and $12 million last year,
            or the Houston Rockets’ James Harden, who just signed an endorsement
            deal with Adidas that will pay him over $15 million per season. It is interesting
            that hockey players aren't usually as involved with brands or endorsed by certain
            companies wanting them to be the face of their brand. This is a strong statement
            to understand that some of us don't know the names of famous hockey players (other than
            the household names like Wayne Gretzky). But we know the names of famous football players
            simply because we see them on ads. This is a powerful statement when it comes to branding yourself.</p>

              budding personality and tailored suits, Subban has gained attention. But not just attention, respect.</p>

                  <p>The NHL has progressively evolved to embracing Subban’s
                    personality. When Subban was featured in a backstage video
                    series in 2014, the NHL media gained popularity which also
                    means they gained followers. They changed their approach to
                    marketing which helped them gain more of a following. Another
                    popular example would move towards social media. When the <span id="kings-button">LA Kings</span>
                    tweeted their victory over the Vancouver Canucks (2012), fans liked
                    that. Fans retweeted causing news to flow through many different mediums.</p>

                <p>All of this is a great example of how important a player can be for a team.
                  Whether it is for the NHL or any team, a player can cause fandom, which markets
                  not just them personally, but the team.</p>
