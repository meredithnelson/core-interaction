      <p>Major League Baseball has had a large following for many decades. The MLB fanbase is widely popular in all subjects: social media following,
      game day attendence, and marketing. All of these aspects have different qualities that make each team special. One aspect that seems to always be of importance is each teams logo.</p>

<section>
  <div id="sox-button">
      <p>Logos have been apart of Major League Baseball since it started. Teams have evolved with their logos throughout the years, creating different followings for each logo. For example, the
      the <font color="#ffaa00">Boston Red Sox</font> have changed their primary logo 8 times and changed their alternate logos 6 times. With each logo came different themes. Their original logo created in 1908, depicting a mens calf wearing a "red sock" with the words Boston running down it, is still used today for their original and traditional looks. You can still
      buy hats that have this logo. Some fans today want to keep the tradition of old logos. This shows that this team, in particular, have carried a fanbase since the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Another team that is commonly known for their infamous logo, is the <font color="#ffaa00">Washington Nationals</font>. The ever so popular "W" has beens seen on hats, shirts, jerseys, and anything you can imagine. DC fans have carried
      their team by wearing them. During games you usually see the infamous W on hats. Hats have been a following since the logo is so simplistic and known. Since 2011, the Nationals have had this W implemented into their brand. Successfully created a following by doing so.
      Their "presidental" approach in the past, such as their primary logo from 2005-2010 made this team seem apart of the red white and blue theme of the nations captial. But when they changed their logo that included the W. They created a name for themselves, rather than following the norm.</p>

          <p>Some will say it is simplistic or not original to just have a letter as a logo, but what they did is create a common, well recognized brand.</p>
        </div>

      <p>Major League Baseball isn't the most popular for their views on television. However, their fanbase is like no other. Fans have been going to games non stop for decades. </p>
